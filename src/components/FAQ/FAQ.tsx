  {
    question: "Whatâ€™s the difference between spray refinishing and liquid Armoglaze?",

    question: "How soon can I use my bathtub after refinishing?",
    answer: "Your tub will be ready to use in just 24 hours after reglazing. The process itself only takes about 4 hours.",

  },
  {
    question: "How long does bathtub reglazing last?",
    answer: "Our Armoglaze refinishing lasts 15-20 years with proper care. It's much more durable than spray polishing.",
